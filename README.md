# tile_mover
My attempt at imitating the moving tiles from Encanto

The second attempt used the notion of a sweep line.

The third attempt I wanted to use a circular design instead of something square. 
I created a script to duplicate a tile and take the number of rows as inputs into a circular pattern.
I then animated it by having the sweep line be a sweep circle to determine if the given center was within the radius
at the given timestep.

This is a reference I was using when designing the tile generator.
